# SBA319 - Job Application Tracker

## Overview
A Full Stack application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **React** (MERN-inspired but not fully MERN yet). This project started as a way to test and practice full-stack CRUD operations, dynamic data handling, and RESTful API integration.

---

## Features
- Manage **Users**, **Companies**, and **Applications**.
- Full **CRUD** functionality for all entities.
- Dynamic **User Selection** when creating applications.
- **Website** support for applications and companies.
- Clean, **dark-themed** responsive frontend.
- MongoDB indexing for optimized data retrieval.
- **Seed script** with mock data for fast setup.

---

## Notes
- This project wasn't initially intended to be fully MERN â€” it was a **test run** to get hands-on with full-stack CRUD concepts.
- Frontend and backend integration was built to **experiment** with real-time data updates, form handling, and API structures.
- The plan is to **continue evolving** this into a more complete MERN application.

---

## Future Plans ðŸš€
- Implement **Authentication/Login** system (JWT or Sessions).
- Add **User Registration** and **role-based access**.
- Build a **Dashboard** with analytics or summaries.
- Add **search, filtering**, and **pagination** to lists.
- Deploy backend to **Render/Heroku**, frontend to **Netlify/Vercel**.
